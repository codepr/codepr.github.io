My name is Andrea, I'm a software engineer messing with computer-related stuff
since my childhood, currently focussing on Python on my day to day job, working
mainly on IoT software and cloud architectures.

## Me in pills

- Prefer Linux environment, with a certain degree of bias
- Passionate about programming, intrigued by distributed and concurrent systems
- Love to learn by doing
- Really love to watch movies (and re-watch them lot of times)
- Somewhat obsessed with minimalism and the neat and lightweight concept
- Dislike bloated interfaces, fancy graphical websites, heavyweight IDEs etc
- Bash over GUI
- Strength workout over cardio
- Constantly looking forward to extend my knowledge
