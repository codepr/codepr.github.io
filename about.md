Hello, I'm a software developer with most of my experience made in small to
medium sized startups, currently working in London in an Elixir shop.

I invest a lot of my spare time in side-projects and deepening my knowledge
exploring various topics, from low level systems, virtual machines and network
based applications, to higher level distributed systems and FP based best
practices. Beside coding:

- I enjoy powerlifting - training bests stand at S: 125kg B: 102.5kg D: 170kg
- I'm currently studying Japanese - 日本語は難しですが面白いです
- I'm developing a taste for good wine, with a knack for Malbec - Catena and Alma Negra among my favourites

This little corner is meant to be as a soft journal where I document some of my
explorations, with no guarantee of consistency. When I feel inspired, I may
drop a couple of lines here.

Most of my work and re-invented wheels can be found in my [Github
profile](https://github.com/codepr).
