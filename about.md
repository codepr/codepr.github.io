Hello, I'm a software developer with most of my experience made in small to
medium sized startups, currently working in London in an Elixir shop.

I invest a lot of my spare time in side-projects and deepening my knowledge
exploring various topics, from low level systems, virtual machines and network
based applications, to higher level distributed systems and FP based best
practices. Beside coding, I enjoy powerlifting, I'm currently studying Japanese
and I'm developing a taste for good red wines, with a knack for Malbec.

This little corner is meant to be as a soft journal where I document some of my
explorations, with no guarantee of consistency. When I feel inspired, I may
drop a couple of lines here.

Most of my work and re-invented wheels can be found in my [Github
profile](https://github.com/codepr).
