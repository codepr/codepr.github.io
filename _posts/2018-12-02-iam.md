I did it! Finally, after years of procrastination and unmaintained
self-promises I'm here at almost 2 AM writing the mandatory hello world to the
chaotic internet sea.  Setting up the blog was at least straight and simple,
just some install commands here and there and wa-hoo, I got my inch of space to
pour some words, not necessarily with a sense; let's say that, most of the time,
this blog wanna be my way to give something back to the community, from which I
learned so much.

Anyway, my name is Andrea Baldan, I am a software engineer, currently focusing
on Python on my day to day job, working mainly on IoT software and cloud
architectures. Passionate about programming, particularly on the topic of
distributed and concurrent systems, constantly looking forward to improve my
knowledge. So, hello world!
